# 3D PLATFORM DEMO LEVEL
This is a small level I had to do for my _3D Animation, videogames and interactive environments_ Course. 
Everything was done by me: models (3DS Max), textures (Substance Painter) and code. Feel free to download and play with it or whatever.

The story is: you are a scientist and you realise that something on the lab is wrong. Pseudoscience is everywhere. Also ghosts. A creature from a 
failed experiment. And the BIG BOSS himself. GOD. 

How does the scientist move around?
- Using AWSD to move to the left, front, back and to the right.

Attack:
- Left mouse click throws a projectile. 
- Right mouse click creates an area attack size 4.
- Jump on an enemy.

You can also gather coffee cups which will give you energy.

Save your position on the checkpoints in case you get killed. You have 3 chances to win this level. After that it's game over.
